# youtube-dl-gui
A GUI utility for [Youtube-DL](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)

This utility simplifies the use of *Youtube-DL*, making it easier to download individual YouTube videos and entire playlists.

It is written in Pascal and can be compiled using [FreePascal](http://www.freepascal.org/), and edited using [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

The GUI generates correctly-formatted Terminal instructions for the YouTube-dl process based on your GUI changes, then executes YouTube-dl accordingly. This means you don't have to memorize all of the various parameters and options.

YouTube-dl-GUI also makes it easier to enqueue multiple YouTube videos (*not contained within a Playlist*) for download, and even to enqueue multiple Playlists for download.
